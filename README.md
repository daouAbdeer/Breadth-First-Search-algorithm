  In this challenge, I cover the Breadth-First Search algorithm and implement it in JavaScript. 
  My demo application is "6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon" (finding the closest relationship between Kevin Bacon and another actor).
  This challenge is part of the spring 2017 ITP "Intelligence and Learning" course.
